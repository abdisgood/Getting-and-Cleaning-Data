This is the repository for final project submission on the course Getting and Cleaning Data offered by John Hopkins University via Coursera.

The project scope includes cleaning and preparation of a data set covering features on observations derived from gyroscope and accelerometer readings on 30 participants wearing mobile devices across a number of different activity states.

The following files are included in the repository:

1. final_dataset.txt -> This is the final clean data set for the project containing the mean values of all mean and standard deviation features from the original data set, sorted by subject and activity state.

2. run_analysis.R -> This is the R script used to download the raw data and transform it into the final required data set.

3. CodeBook.md -> This file provides an overview of the project scope, methodology and variables included in the final dataset submission.
